## Project Overview**

MastoRide is a ride-booking web application built exclusively for **Purdue University Fort Wayne (PFW)** students. The platform provides a safe, affordable, and structured way for students to book rides to off-campus locations. It includes role-based access for Guests, Registered Students, and Administrators, each with specific functionalities tailored to their needs.

## Problem Statement**

PFW students frequently encounter transportation challenges due to:

* Expensive commercial ride services
* Unreliable public transportation
* Lack of structured or student-friendly ride options
* No centralized place to track bookings, payments, or ride history

As a result, students may miss important academic and personal commitments.

A dedicated, student-focused transportation platform is required to provide **affordable**, **safe**, and **trackable** ride options.
